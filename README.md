# Melbourne Watch Gallery Website

Hi,

It is a small project about a website where I simulated a store that sells smartwatches. 

There is a database that contains all the information displayed.

The website consists of 

- a home page where all products are displayed, 
- an individual webpage for each product, 
- an about us page
- management page, where sign-in is required, and management people can delete, add and update products to the database.

I used CSS, HTML, JavaScript, PHP and SQL languages.
